This is a small database project that records a tournament matches and players data.
It is assumed that this project will be used for Swiss-system tournaments.

An interface is provided for connecting and communicating with the underlying
database (PostgreSQL is used in development) in tournament.

To use, and further build on top of this project, run tournament.sql on a
PostgreSQL database (\i tournament.sql) to create the database.
